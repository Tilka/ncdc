NCDC 0.1-alpha
==============

DESCRIPTION

  NCDC aims to become an awesome Direct Connect client with an NCurses
  interface, written in OCaml and C. It is currently in a very early alpha
  stage and nothing useful has been implemented yet.


REQUIREMENTS

  Run-time:
    ncurses

  Compile-time:
    OCaml
    Most likely: A recent GCC


QUICK Q&A

  Q: Why another DC client?
  A: Because the current DC clients either require a full graphical setup, or are
     extremely buggy and have not been updated for years. While I *could* fork or
     take over development for nanodc or microdc2, I don't really enjoy playing
     around with other people's code. Nor do I really enjoy the readline interface
     of microdc2 or the C++ bloat that comes with nanodc.

  Q: Why OCaml and C?
  A: Most current DC clients are written in C++, which isn't a language I like.
     I do enjoy C, but it's too much work to write larger applications using it.
     I tend to avoid writing applications like this in higher level languages
     like Perl or Python due to the memory and CPU overhead and all the
     extra dependencies it would require.
     Ocaml is a nice mid-level language which offers many nice features for
     keeping the code organized, and is also the only language I know of that
     makes it incredibly easy to interface with C code.
     Taking all that into account: I decided to use OCaml for everything that
     can be done in OCaml, and C for everything that requires external
     libraries or performance.
